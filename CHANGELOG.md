## 1.0.1

- Added a shortcut for *Picture-in-Picture* (PIP) (fixes #36).
- Separated player-related stuff into another object (`Player`) (fixes #66).
- Added interoperability with JS (`lib/src/utils/player_interop.dart`).
- Now going in or out of fullscreen toggles the active video element.

## 1.0.0

Hopefully this doesn't have any hidden bugs. All of the major core features have now been included. Take a look a previous (pre-)releases for more info on the history of development.

Some added features from the last beta version are:

- Now YouTube's video element has a decoration at the bottom for when it is or isn't the active HTML element.
    - This will help the user know when his keys will act on the document or the video element.
- Focusing on the comment box now uses <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>[</kbd> instead of <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>m</kbd>, which would conflict with muting the video.
    - <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>[</kbd> conflicts with a spherical video shortcut, but that will be solved in the future with #55.
- Added a shortcut for toggling the expansion of the description.
- Better, more performant event handling in page transitions.
- Better code overall.
- Documentation minor improvements.

## 0.1.0-beta
